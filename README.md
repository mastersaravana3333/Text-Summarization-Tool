🧠 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

This project implements an automatic Text Summarization Tool using Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal of the application is to generate a concise and meaningful summary from a long input text while preserving its core information and context.
The system uses a pre-trained transformer-based model to understand the semantic structure of the text and extract its most relevant points. Users can easily modify or replace the input text in Google Colab, making the tool flexible and user-friendly.
This task demonstrates practical usage of NLP models in handling large textual data efficiently. Text summarization tools are widely used in news platforms, research analysis, documentation processing, and content management systems.

⚙️ 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀

The implementation uses a transformer-based summarization pipeline. The input text is tokenized and processed by the pre-trained model, which analyzes sentence structure, semantic relationships, and contextual importance. The model then generates a summarized output by focusing on the most meaningful segments of the text.
The code is structured in a clear and readable manner, allowing users to easily replace the input text and regenerate summaries. No manual preprocessing is required, as the model internally handles tokenization and summarization logic.
